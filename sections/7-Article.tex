\subsection{Tracing Analysis}

 Tracing involves a specialized use of logging that records runtime events about a program's execution. 
 Tracing is used to detect and identify performance issues, behavior issues and security issues (FIND SOURCE HERE). Tracing can be done on several levels including user-space, kernel, hardware, hypervisor, network, etc. Software that capture those events is called a tracer. To capture those events, tracepoints must be inserted either statically or dynamically. In the case that the tracepoint is inserted statically, the code must be modified to include tracing macros and must be recompiled. In the case that the tracepoint is inserted dynamically, tracepoints are added dynamically to a compiled and running program (Gregg and Mauro, 2011). During the execution of the program, events will be emitted and a tracer will capture them. At this point, a tracer will produce a trace file, organized in a specific format. Because the tracer have to run at the same time of the main application, it will impact the execution time of the main application. This is why a tracer must have a minimal execution overhead. When the tracer finish to produce a trace file, we can apply a trace analysis.

 A trace analysis transforms the trace events into a dataset to perform more investigation and it reorganizes them into data structure for faster access (Prieur-Drevon et al., 2018).

 \subsection{Integrated Development Environment}
 
 % IDE evolution: No plugins, Plugins, Server Protocol, Desktop base IDE, Cloud base IDE, Hybrid base IDE
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of software development. These powerful software tools have evolved significantly over the years, revolutionizing the way developers write, debug, and maintain code. These IDEs greatly enhanced developer productivity and set the stage for more sophisticated tools. IDEs like Microsoft Visual Studio provided comprehensive solutions for building complex software applications. Developers could now easily navigate through code, leverage libraries, and visually design user interfaces within a single environment. It is clear those IDEs help developers to be more and more productive, depending on the developing phase. The developers get a lot of support from IDEs. The problem is, each time that we add features in IDEs, it become more harder for developer to reach the  productive stage [Article 5]. That is why developers start using IDEs that have basic feature of an text editor and enhance it, using plugins and extension, to become a full featured IDE [Article 6]. 


% Different Server Protocol aujourd'hui mis en place
A lot of work as been put to decouple the support of programming language such as code completion, code error, syntax highlighting and go-to definition [Article 7]. Microsoft's language server protocol (LSP) is a communication protocol, based on JSON-RPC, between a client, which is the IDE, and a server that oﬀers language support [Article 8].


% Microsoft’s language server protocol (LSP) is a communication protocol, based on JSON-RPC, between a client, which is the IDE, and a server that oﬀers language support (Keidel et al., 2016). At this time, the LSP does not specify how the messages exchanged should be transferred and the client is responsible for managing the server’s lifetime. The protocol provides common features such as code completion, code error, syntax highlighting and go-to deﬁnition. Many organizations such as the Eclipse Foundation, Github, and JetBrains are adapting their popular IDE (Eclipse, Atom, IntelliJ) to implement the LSP. Keidel et al. have presented Monto (Keidel et al., 2016) which follows the same idea as the LSP, but their approach allows the language server to be stateless. Services are responsible for providing the common language features, and those services may also be composed of smaller services. Moreover, in comparison to the LSP, their solution doesn't have to maintain and update a copy of the source code. Marr et al. have presented the Kómpos protocol (Marr et al., 2017) which is a concurrency-agnostic debugger protocol. Its goal is to decouple the debugger from the concurrency models such as threads, locks, communication event loops, and others. The protocol provides support for common features such as breakpoints, step-by-step and visualization of the interaction of concurrent models. In comparison to existing debugger protocol such as Java Debug Wire Protocol or the GDB machine interface, their solution is not speciﬁc to a concurrency concept. Eﬀtinge and Kosyakov have presented Theia (Eﬀtinge and Kosyakov, 2017), a new open-source IDE framework for building IDEs that could run both as a desktop application or in a web browser connected to a remote backend. The project shares a lot of similarities with Microsoft's code editor, Visual Studio Code. Theia uses Node.js, Electron and implements the LSP
