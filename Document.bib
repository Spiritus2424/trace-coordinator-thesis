  abstract  = {Modern malware is becoming hard to spot since attackers are increasingly adopting new techniques to elude signature- and rule-based detection mechanisms. Among the others, steganography and information hiding can be used to bypass security frameworks searching for suspicious communications between processes or exfiltration attempts through covert channels. Since the array of potential carriers is very large (e.g., information can be hidden in hardware resources, various multimedia files or network flows), detecting this class of threats is a scarcely generalizable process and gathering multiple behavioral information is time-consuming, lacks scalability, and could lead to performance degradation. In this paper, we leverage the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), which is a recent code augmentation feature provided by the Linux kernel, for programmatically tracing and monitoring the behavior of software processes in a very efficient way. To prove the flexibility of the approach, we investigate two realistic use cases implementing different attack mechanisms, i.e., two processes colluding via the alteration of the file system and hidden network communication attempts nested within IPv6 traffic flows. Our results show that even simple eBPF programs can provide useful data for the detection of anomalies, with a minimal overhead. Furthermore, the flexibility to develop and run such programs allows to extract relevant features that could be used for the creation of datasets for feeding security frameworks exploiting AI.<br/> &copy; 2021},

  abstract  = {The dynamic nature of applications in Virtual Machines (VMs) and the increasing demand for virtualized systems make the analysis of dynamic environments critical to achieve efficient operation of such complex distributed systems. In this article, we propose a precise host-based tracing and analysis method to retrieve execution flows, and dependency flows from virtualized environments, regardless of the level of nested virtualization. Given a host operating system level trace, the Any-Level vCPU Detection (ASD) algorithm and Guest Thread-state Analysis (GTA) algorithm detect the different states of vCPUs and threads for arbitrary nesting depths. Then, the Execution-graph Construction (HEC) algorithm extracts the waiting / wake-up dependencies chains out of the running processes across VMs, for any level of virtualization in a transparent manner. The process dependency graph, vCPU state, and VM process state are displayed in an interactive trace viewer, Trace Compass, for further inspection. Our proposed VM trace analysis algorithms have been open-sourced for further enhancements and collaborative research and development. Our new techniques were evaluated with workloads generated using several well-known server applications (e.g., Hadoop, Apache, MySQL, Linux apt-get, and IMS network). The proposed approaches are based on host hypervisor tracing, which brings a lower tracing overhead (around 1 percent), is easier to deploy, and presents fewer security issues as compared to other approaches.},

This mainly brings in the challenge of observability. By providing a deeper understanding into the functioning of distributed applications, observability enables improving the performance of the system by obtaining a view of the bottlenecks in the implementation. The observability provided by currently existing tools that perform dynamic tracing on distributed applications is limited to the user-space and requires the application to be instrumented to track request flows. In this paper, we present a new open-source framework MiSeRTrace that can trace the end-to-end path of requests entering a microservice application at the kernel space without requiring instrumentation or modification of the application. Observability at the comprehensiveness of the kernel space allows breaking down of various steps in activities such as network transfers and IO tasks, thus enabling root cause based performance analysis and accurate identification of hotspots. MiSeRTrace supports tracing user-enabled kernel events provided by frameworks such as bpftrace or ftrace and isolates kernel activity associated with each application request with minimal overheads. We then demonstrate the working of the solution with results on a benchmark microservice application.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 ACM.},

Such wait dependencies are invisible to instruction profilers. We propose a host-based, precise method to recover recursively wait causes across machines, using blocking as the fundamental mechanism to detect changes in the control flow. It relies solely on operating system events, namely scheduling, interrupts and network events. It is therefore capable of observing kernel threads interactions and achieves user-space runtime independence. Given a task, the algorithm computes its active path from the trace, which is presented in an interactive viewer for inspection. We validated our new method with workloads representing major architecture and operating conditions found in distributed programs. We then used our method to analyze the execution behavior of five different distributed systems. We found that the worst case tracing overhead for a distributed application is 18 percent and that the typical average overhead is about 5 percent. The analysis implementation has linear runtime according to the trace size.},

C'est pour cela que les sp{\'e}cialistes des syst{\`e}mes distribu{\'e}s et de l'analyse de performance d{\'e}veloppent des analyses complexes, qui sont ensuite int{\'e}gr{\'e}es aux outils de visualisation de traces. Ces outils supposent que le processus de tra{\c c}age s'est d{\'e}roul{\'e} sans erreurs. N{\'e}anmoins, il arrive que des {\'e}v{\'e}nements soient perdus. Ceci survient lorsque les structures de donn{\'e}es (souvent des tampons circulaires) devant stocker les {\'e}v{\'e}nements avant leur {\'e}criture dans la trace sur disque sont pleins, alors que d'autres {\'e}v{\'e}nements sont g{\'e}n{\'e}r{\'e}s. Pour {\'e}viter de bloquer le syst{\`e}me, le traceur doit jeter les {\'e}v{\'e}nements les plus r{\'e}cents, ou {\'e}craser les plus anciens. Il n'existe pas de m{\'e}canisme pour g{\'e}rer ce cas lors de l'analyse de trace, ce qui cr{\'e}e des incoh{\'e}rences dans les r{\'e}sultats sans que l'utilisateur en soit notifi{\'e}. L'objectif de cette recherche est donc d'{\'e}tudier le probl{\`e}me des {\'e}v{\'e}nements perdus dans une trace lors de son analyse, et d'apporter des solutions permettant d'indiquer les incoh{\'e}rences et d'y rem{\'e}dier. Notre hypoth{\`e}se {\'e}tait que les {\'e}v{\'e}nements pr{\'e}sents dans la trace contiennent suffisament d'information pour pouvoir d{\'e}tecter un changement d'{\'e}tat qui n'aurait pas d{\^u} avoir lieu, et pour compl{\'e}ter la chronologie manquante. Pour cela, nous avons utilis{\'e} des machines {\`a} {\'e}tats finis, puisque ce formalisme de repr{\'e}sentation permet de mod{\'e}liser le syst{\`e}me {\'e}tudi{\'e}, en d{\'e}finissant la fa{\c c}on dont les {\'e}v{\'e}nements g{\'e}n{\`e}rent des changements d'{\'e}tats. Ces machines {\`a} {\'e}tats poss{\`e}dent des propri{\'e}t{\'e}s qui peuvent {\^e}tre exploit{\'e}es pour retrouver les informations perdues.  ABSTRACT: With tracing, a lot of information can be gathered from a system or an application. This information needs to be exploited in order to provide a useful insight into the operation of our system. Experts develop complex trace analyses, but it does not take into account the fact that some events may have been lost during the tracing process, due to a much bigger flow of generated events than the capacity of writing into the trace. Therefore, the results may contain some inconsistencies. Our objective is to deal with these lost events at the trace analysis level. Using finite state machines to model the system, we are able to check the certainty of each new state. If no transition can be triggered from the current state, we check if one could be triggered from another state. By doing so, we can find inconsistencies. Then, we can correct these by looking for the sequence of transitions between the last coherent state and the incoherent one. Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm is applied, with frequencies used as weights for the transitions. Once the transitions have been inferred, we can deduce the related lost events and their content. The proposed solution has been implemented in Trace Compass, a trace visualisation tool. The new information is displayed on the view representing the results of the analysis. It allowed us to apply our method to a few usecases, thus demonstrating its usefulness. The accuracy of the recovery phase is 53\%. The overhead of the detection phase is reasonable for small traces, but can increase rapidly for bigger ones. However, the inference phase does not cost too much in any case.}

  abstract  = {Quantitative prediction of quality properties (i.e. extra-functional properties such as performance, reliability, and cost) of software architectures during design supports a systematic software engineering approach. Designing architectures that exhibit a good trade-off between multiple quality criteria is hard, because even after a functional design has been created, many remaining degrees of freedom in the software architecture span a large, discontinuous design space. In current practice, software architects try to find solutions manually, which is time-consuming, can be error-prone and can lead to suboptimal designs. We propose an automated approach to search the design space for good solutions. Starting with a given initial architectural model, the approach iteratively modifies and evaluates architectural models. Our approach applies a multi-criteria genetic algorithm to software architectures modelled with the Palladio Component Model. It supports quantitative performance, reliability, and cost prediction and can be extended to other quantitative quality criteria of software architectures. We validate the applicability of our approach by applying it to an architecture model of a component-based business information system and analyse its quality criteria trade-offs by automatically investigating more than 1200 alternative design candidates.},

  abstract  = {Chapter 2 presents various architectures of P2P systems. We first introduce a taxonomy of P2P architectures, where we classify P2P systems into three main categories: centralized P2P systems, decentralized P2P systems, and hybrid P2P systems. While centralized P2P systems are systems that are supported by centralized servers, decentralized P2P systems are pure P2P systems, which are completely decentralized. On the other hand, hybrid systems are systems where nodes are organized into two layers: the upper tier super nodes act as servers for lower tier nodes. After the introduction, for each of these P2P categories, we discuss in details its properties as well as outstanding P2P systems belonging to its category. In particular, for centralized P2P systems, we introduce Napster and SETI@home. For decentralized P2P systems, we present Gnutella, PAST, Canon, and Skip Graph. Finally, for hybrid P2P systems, we show BestPeer, a self-configurable P2P system.},

  abstract = {The genetic algorithm (GA), one of the best-known metaheuristic algorithms, has been extensively utilized in various fields of management science, operational research, and industrial engineering. The efficiency of GAs in solving large-scale optimization problems would be enhanced if the iterative processes required by the genetic operators can be implemented in a parallel and distributed computing architecture. Apache Hadoop has recently been one of the most popular systems for distributed storage and parallel processing of big data. By integrating the GA highly into Apache Hadoop, this study proposes an advanced GA parallel and distributed computing architecture that achieves the effectiveness and efficiency of GA evolution. Characterized by the sophisticated mechanism of dispatching the GA core operators into Apache Hadoop, the developed computing framework fits well with the cloud computing model. The presented GA parallelization architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art reference architectures according to the computational experiments where the testing instances of traveling salesman problems are employed. Our numerical experiments also demonstrate that the proposed architecture can readily be extended to Apache Spark.}

  abstract = {R{\'E}SUM{\'E}: La conception et le d{\'e}veloppement de logiciels requi{\`e}rent souvent l'utilisation d'un Environnement de D{\'e}veloppement Int{\'e}gr{\'e} (EDI) pour assister et faciliter le travail des d{\'e}veloppeurs. Les EDI offrent, {\`a} travers une interface graphique, des outils pour l'{\'e}dition, la compilation et le d{\'e}bogage du code. Cependant, lorsque ces outils ne sont pas adapt{\'e}s et suffisants pour la d{\'e}tection de d{\'e}fauts de performance sur des logiciels complexes, comme les syst{\`e}mes distribu{\'e}s, les d{\'e}veloppeurs se tournent vers des techniques de tra{\c c}age. Des logiciels appel{\'e}s traceurs r{\'e}coltent des informations pr{\'e}cises pendant l'ex{\'e}cution du syst{\`e}me instrument{\'e}, et les regroupent dans une trace. Une trace peut contenir une quantit{\'e} importante de donn{\'e}es. Des outils sp{\'e}cialis{\'e}s ont {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}velopp{\'e}s afin d'en automatiser le processus d'analyse et de visualisation. Au fur et {\`a} mesure qu'un logiciel grandit et se complexifie, l'utilisation de ces outils d'analyse et de visualisation devient tout aussi importante qu'un d{\'e}bogueur. N{\'e}anmoins, ces outils sont complexes, autonomes et difficilement r{\'e}utilisables dans d'autres syst{\`e}mes. De plus, ils ne supportent pas les m{\^e}mes analyses, les m{\^e}mes formats de trace, ni les m{\^e}mes cas d'utilisation, ce qui implique que le d{\'e}veloppeur ait besoin d'installer plusieurs outils pour arriver {\`a} ses fins. Dans le cadre de ce projet, nous cherchons donc {\`a} r{\'e}soudre ces probl{\`e}mes et {\`a} int{\'e}grer l'analyse et la visualisation de trace non seulement dans les EDI, mais dans tout autre syst{\`e}me qui pourrait en b{\'e}n{\'e}ficier, tels que les serveurs d'int{\'e}gration continue ou encore les syst{\`e}mes de monitorage. Par cons{\'e}quent, nous proposons une nouvelle architecture logicielle flexible bas{\'e}e sur une approche client-serveur, d'architecture orient{\'e}e service et multicouche. Notre travail s'{\'e}tend {\`a} l'impl{\'e}mentation de l'architecture du serveur au sein du projet Trace Compass et l'impl{\'e}mentation de l'architecture du client au sein d'un nouveau projet appel{\'e} TraceScape. Toutes nos contributions sont disponibles {\`a} code source ouvert. Des tests de performance ont {\'e}t{\'e} men{\'e}s afin d'{\'e}valuer le surco{\^u}t associ{\'e} {\`a} la nouvelle architecture par rapport {\`a} la pr{\'e}c{\'e}dente approche, et les r{\'e}sultats indiquent un surco{\^u}t acceptable.  ABSTRACT: Creating software often requires using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to help and facilitate the development work. With a simplified user interface, IDEs provide many useful tools such as a code editor, a compiler, and a debugger. Nonetheless, when those tools are not enough to detect performance defects in a large, complex and multithreaded system, developers use tracing techniques. A program called tracer collects accurate information during the execution of an instrumented system. A trace could contain a lot of data, and specialized tools have been developed to analyze traces automatically and show the results in interactive views. As the software grows and becomes more complex, using trace visualization tools must be part of the developer tool environment, like the debugger in the software development process. However, trace visualization tools are sophisticated, standalone and hardly reusable in other systems such as an IDE. Moreover, they have their specific trace format support, specific use cases, and specific trace analyses. Most of the time, developers need to install and use several such tools to fulfill their needs. In this research project, we aim to solve those problems and integrate trace analysis and visualization in tools such as IDEs, monitoring systems or continuous integration systems. Thus, we propose a flexible software architecture based on client-server, service-oriented architecture and layered approaches. We implemented the server architecture in the Trace Compass project and the client architecture in a new project called TraceScape. All of our contributions are available online in open source repositories. We also evaluated our proposed architecture through benchmarks, and the results show that our approach has an acceptable overhead compared to the standalone approach.}
